## Hello there 👋
<p>🧸 I'm Thuỳ Dương from Việt Nam and I'm currently studying at Le Hong Phong High School for the gifted as a CAer (English-specialized student). </p>
<p>🦋 I have always been passionate about creating new things without limit by myself and for myself. Therefore, you guessed it, coding was eye-opening for me. It's not only a playground for my brain but it also allows me to experience the joy of accomplishment  </p>
<p>🍂 Here, at GitHub, I will post little projects I did so feel free to ask, help and feedback as I also hope to become better. Reach out to me through <a href="mailto:daisyduong118@gmail.com"> my email </a>. </p>
<p>☕ Come along the journey with me and this delicious croissant 🥐 </p>
